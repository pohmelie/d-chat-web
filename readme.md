Some parts of this project can be used in other ones. Like:
* bit32 — subset of lua bit32 library for 'proper' bit shifts (no, js shifts is **not** good ones)
* construct — subset of python construct library (python construct is just awesome!)
* convert — utf-8 <-> bin <-> hex string convertion library (it's just for java <-> js bridge)
